PRODIGY_DS_01
The first task of Data Science internship.
I visualized population data by leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating a bar chart, 
I analyzed population distribution by country for 2023. This task helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization in Python.
